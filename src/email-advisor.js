*Analyzes patterns*

Claude: "Based on patterns, here's what I found:
- 5 unread emails from today
- 2 with 'urgent' in subject line  
- 3 from addresses you frequently respond to
- 1 with attachments from your boss

Recommendations:
1. Email from boss@ with attachment (received 2 hours ago)
2. 'Urgent: Project deadline' from colleague@ 
3. Questions from client@ (you usually respond within 4 hours)

Would you like me to:
- Draft responses to any of these?
- Create calendar events from meeting requests?
- Archive old newsletters?"
